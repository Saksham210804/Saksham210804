#  Welcome to My Realm of Code & Creativity!

Hey there! I'm **Saksham**, and you've just stepped into my digital forge — where creativity meets code, and ideas evolve into immersive worlds.

##  Game Developer by Passion, Coder by Obsession

From pixel-perfect collisions to AI that actually *feels alive*, I breathe life into virtual worlds through:
- 🔹 **Unity** — My go-to engine for crafting captivating experiences.
- 🔹 **C#** — My spellbook for scripting mechanics, movement, and magic.
- 🔹 **C++** — My toolkit for performance-heavy logic and core game systems.
- 🔹 **Python** — My thinking hat for rapid prototyping, tools, and AI logic.

##  What Drives Me?

As a kid i feel proud that i used to play contra like a pro, now i want to create experiences which could make kids go mad, exactly how i felt when i died again and again. I build games using two tools. Imagination. Curiosity. The thrill of building something that *feels alive*.  
I don't just build games — I build **experiences**. I believe every line of code is a brushstroke in an evolving canvas.

Whether it’s:
- Crafting a combat system that *feels* just right
- Animating the subtle flicker of torchlight
- Or designing the perfect loop that hooks the player

...I’m all in. Every single time.

##  My World is Built With:

-  Unity (2D/3D, URP, Cinemachine, DOTween, Shader Graph)
-  C# (Event systems, OOP, ECS, Design Patterns)
-  C++ (Game mechanics, custom tools, performance optimization)
-  Python (AI, automation, procedural generation tools)

##  What's Next?

Right now, I’m working on **Bladeborne**, my latest Unity-powered passion project.  
(Coming soon to a repo near you. Stay tuned.)
